# Project for finding defects on electronic circuit boards
Our program recognizes 6 defects on printed circuit boards such as:
1. Missing hole
2. Mouse bite
3. Open circuit
4. Short
5. Spur
6. Spurious copper

### Technologies
- [YOLOv5](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5)
- [YOLOv8](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics)
- [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com)
- [ClearML](https://clear.ml)

### System Requirements 
You will need ~10 GB of free disk space to deploy the container on your machine

### Architecture 

![ml_pipeline.jpg](images/ml_pipeline.jpg)

### Deploy
The system consists of three services: 

- Django - a web application that provides a way for the user to upload a picture of the chip
- RabbitMQ - as a task broker to organize a message queue between the model and the application
- Fast API - program interface for sending the results of the YOLO model work

Using Docker compose, the system can be started using the following steps:

- Clone the given repository
- Run docker on your machine
- ```sudo docker-compose build```
- ```sudo docker-compose up -d```.

⚠️ **disclaimer:** this version is a test version, and fulfills the task of demonstrating the outcomes of the computer vision course.

### Demonstration of the program operation

### Limitations
The following things can be emphasized as limitations at the moment:
1. Frame rate per second - 4 (since the response time of the model is 200-250 ms).

### Success Metrics
As a business metric, we use the reduction in enterprise costs and board survey time by replacing controllers 
REA by the service being developed.

We used mAP50-95 (mean Average Precision in the range [.50: .05: .95]: 0.5 to 0.95 with a step size of 0.05 as the metric for evaluating the success of the experiments. The original goal was to achieve a value of at least 0.9, which was achieved in experiment 8 - we achieved mAP50-95 = 0.9289
